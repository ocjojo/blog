Hi there,

my name is Lukas and on this blog I document my experiences in development and computer science. Mostly I do this as reference for myself. If you find it helpful as well even better!

Sometimes I lack the patience to research and fact-check everything :D
If you find mistakes in my posts or have feedback in general, please let me know.
